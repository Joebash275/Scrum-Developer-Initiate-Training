# Self-Discipline
Self-Discipline is a necessary ingredient to become a Scrum developer.
They do not seek to control others, but instead seek to master themselves.
Without self-discipline a Scrum developer cannot get far in their training.
Part of self-discipline is personal responsibility.
Ultimately you are responsible for your own fate, determined by the decisions you have made in the circumstances you find yourself in.
A Scrum developer does not blame others for shortcomings and failures and uses such setbacks as a learning experience.
A self-disciplined Scrum developer will be industrious, and in control of their emotions.
Having no unnecessary attachments, they can act forthrightly and without fear.
